## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a neutral space for announcements.  
In today’s world, companies, individuals, and even local governments rely heavily on social media to share information. We feel that this dependence on specific corporate platforms is not always healthy. Some people dislike using social media apps, while others use them reluctantly just to follow updates. This situation can also create information gaps.  
**Announcing** was created as a non-commercial alternative — a simple, open place to share information.
