<h1>Concept</h1>

<div class="text">
  Announcing is a web service that lets anyone post announcements, similar to how social media
  works.
  <br />
  Unfortunately, it doesn’t include the following features:
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Like buttons</li>
  <li>Reposts or quote posts</li>
  <li>Replies</li>
  <li>Impression tracking</li>
</ul>

<div class="text">
  You can’t go viral—or get canceled—after spending all night crafting the perfect post.
  <br />
  You also can’t keep checking likes or impressions every 10 minutes.<br />
  And you won’t be disappointed by a total lack of reactions.
</div>

<h2>Post and Read Announcements</h2>
<div class="text">
  Once you’ve created a channel, just share the URL.<br />
  For example, you could print a QR code and post it in your store.<br />
  No app or account is required to read announcements.<br />
  No need for common exchanges like “Please follow me!” or “Sorry, I don’t use that app.”
</div>

<div class="text">
  You can only read channels you know.<br />
  There’s no timeline tracking your behavior or blending in carefully targeted ads.<br />
  And of course, you’re not going to be nudged in any direction.
</div>

<h2>Features</h2>
<div class="text">
  Announcing isn't a service that replaces social media.<br />
  Social media is powerful—it lets you spread information, get feedback, and communicate.<br />
  Announcing is a complement to social media for those who feel it doesn’t quite suit them.<br />
  But if you don’t see value in those social features, Announcing might be enough on its own.
</div>

<div class="text">
  Announcing is completely free to use.<br />
  In the future, we hope to support the service through donations.
