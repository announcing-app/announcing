<h1>iPhone/iPad Notification Settings</h1>

<div class="text info">
  Announcing allows you to receive new notifications without installing an app.<br />
  However, on iPhone and iPad, a bit of extra setup is required.<br />
  This is because what works on Android and Windows isn’t fully supported yet on iOS.<br />
  We plan to improve this as soon as Apple makes the necessary changes.
